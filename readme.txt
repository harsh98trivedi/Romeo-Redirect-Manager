== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the difference between 301 and 308 redirects? =

Both are permanent redirects, but 308 preserves the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) while 301 may change POST to GET. For most use cases, 308 is the modern recommended choice.

= Will this affect my site's performance? =

No! Romeo Redirect Manager is built with performance in mind. It uses native JavaScript with zero heavy dependencies and optimized database queries.

= Can I redirect to internal posts? =

Yes! The plugin includes an intelligent autocomplete feature that lets you search and select any post or page on your site as a redirect target.

= Is this plugin compatible with caching plugins? =

Yes, Romeo Redirect Manager works great alongside popular caching plugins. Redirects are processed at the PHP level before caching kicks in.

Each redirect card displays a hit counter showing how many times it has been used. This helps you identify your most popular links.
