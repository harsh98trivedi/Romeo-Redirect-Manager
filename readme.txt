== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between 301 and 308 redirects? =
Both are permanent redirects. However, **301** may change the HTTP method (e.g., POST becomes GET), while **308** preserves it. 308 is the modern standard for permanent redirects.

= Does this track how many people use the redirects? =
Yes! Every redirect card shows a live "Hit Counter" so you can easily identify your most popular links.

= Will this slow down my website? =
No. Romeo Redirect Manager is built for performance. It uses lightweight native code and runs efficient database queries only when necessary.

= Can I redirect to internal posts/pages easily? =
Yes. The "Target Type" selector allows you to choose "Internal Post" or "Internal Page", which gives you a search bar to instantly find any Page or Post on your site.
